We have build a genetic algorithm with added on hill climbing that works to solve Nurikabe logic puzzles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurikabe_(puzzle))

To run the program:
go to aiProject2\AIProject2\Program.cs and then build and run that. It's currently set up to run phase3, but you can make small adjustments for it to run phase 1 or phase 2 instead

To add a test file:
go to the folder aiProject2\AIProject2\bin\Debug and place the file there as a txt

To view an output results file:
go to the folder aiProject2\AIproject2\bin\Debug and open the file. The name will be <filename>Results.txt
If you run the same file multiple times, it will write over the previous file, so if you plan on doing that copy the file over somewhere else first.
